## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Data Protection

#### 5.1.1 Sensitive Data Encryption
- Gift pin numbers must be encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
- All personal information must be encrypted at rest
- All data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.3

#### 5.1.2 Data Access Controls
- Access to gift data must be restricted based on user roles
- Recipients should only be able to access their own gifts
- Senders should only be able to access gifts they have sent
- Administrative access must be logged and audited

### 5.2 Authentication and Authorization

#### 5.2.1 Recipient Authentication
- Recipients must verify their mobile number before accessing gift details
- One-time password (OTP) verification should be implemented for gift access
- Session tokens for gift access should have a short expiration time

#### 5.2.2 API Security
- All API endpoints must be protected with OAuth 2.0
- Rate limiting must be implemented to prevent abuse
- Input validation must be performed on all API requests

### 5.3 Fraud Prevention

#### 5.3.1 Gift Redemption Controls
- Implement measures to prevent multiple redemptions of the same gift
- Track unusual patterns of gift creation or redemption
- Implement velocity checks for gift purchases
